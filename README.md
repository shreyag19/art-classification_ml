## Dataset Information üìä

The project utilizes a dataset of paintings available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/painter-by-numbers/data), originally sourced from [WikiArt](https://www.wikiart.org). The dataset comprises images from 2319 different artists and 43 unique painting genres.

### File Descriptions

- **train.zip**: Zip file containing the images in the training set (.jpg)
- **test.zip**: Zip file containing the images in the test set (.jpg)
- **train_info.csv**: File listing image filename, artistID, genre, style, date, and title for images in the training set.
- **all_data_info.csv**: File containing additional information such as dimensions, size in bytes, artist group, etc.

### Filtering and Thresholding

The project focuses on a subset of artists, applying a threshold of 500 paintings to include an artist in the dataset. This approach ensures balanced classes, manageable model complexity, and quality representation of the artists' styles.

The filtered dataset includes the following 12 artists, representing a variety of 30 unique painting genres:

- Ivan Aivazovsky
- Gustave Dore
- Rembrandt
- Pierre-Auguste Renoir
- Albrecht Durer
- Ivan Shishkin
- Giovanni Battista Piranesi
- John Singer Sargent
- Zdislav Beksinski
- Ilya Repin
- Pablo Picasso
- Marc Chagall

Please adhere to the terms and utilize the images only for the purposes of data mining, which constitutes a form of fair use.

## Architecture and Models üèóÔ∏è

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

  <br>
  <em>Architecture of the Convolutional Neural Network used in the project</em>
</p>

The CNN model employed in this project is built with multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers, fully connected layers, and a softmax activation function. It is designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from the input images.

### Transfer Learning with ResNet50

The project also explores transfer learning using the [ResNet50](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.resnet50.html) architecture. ResNet50 is a deep residual network that has 50 layers, including convolutional and fully connected layers. By leveraging pre-trained weights from the ImageNet dataset, the ResNet50 model is fine-tuned to adapt to the specific art classification task.

For more detailed information about the ResNet50 architecture, refer to the [official PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.resnet50.html).

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The SVM model used in this study utilizes different kernel functions and hyperparameter tuning to classify the artworks based on extracted features. It serves as a comparison to understand the advantages and potential limitations of deep learning models for art classification.

Certainly! Here's the Results section that provides a concise summary of the outcomes from the CNN, ResNet, and SVM models. You can add this section to the existing documentation:

## Results üìà

The project experimented with different machine learning models to classify art images. Below are the summarized results for each approach:

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

The CNN model achieved a test accuracy of approximately 59.70%. The model showed progressive improvement during training and reached its best performance after 16 epochs. Here are some highlights:

- **Training Accuracy**: 69.84%
- **Validation Accuracy**: 59.69%
- **Test Loss**: 1.2615
- **Test Accuracy**: 59.70%

### Transfer Learning with ResNet50

By leveraging the ResNet50 architecture, the model achieved a significant test accuracy of approximately 72.37%. The model stopped early after 10 epochs due to no improvement in validation loss. The results are:

- **Training Accuracy**: 205.25 (custom metric)
- **Validation Accuracy**: 74.74%
- **Test Loss**: 0.9001
- **Test Accuracy**: 72.37%

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The SVM model, utilized as a comparative baseline, achieved a test accuracy of 55.67%. A detailed classification report shows varying performance across different classes:

- **Test Accuracy**: 55.67%
- **Precision**: Ranges from 0.37 to 0.72 across classes
- **Recall**: Ranges from 0.29 to 0.89 across classes
- **F1-Score**: Ranges from 0.33 to 0.78 across classes

The SVM results highlight the advantages and potential limitations of using classical machine learning techniques for complex art classification tasks.

These results offer valuable insights into the effectiveness of different machine learning techniques in art classification. While deep learning models like CNN and ResNet50 showed promising results, the comparative study with SVM provides a comprehensive perspective on the challenges and potentials in art classification.
